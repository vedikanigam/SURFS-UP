# Surfs-Up-Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis

In this project, we are analysing a weather dataset for an investor W.Avy who is going to invest in a business plan for a Surf and Shake shop in Oahu. Using database engine SQLite and SQLalchemy (a query tool for SQLite), we will run some analytics for june and december weather in Oahu. 

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to find temperature statistics for the months of June and December in Oahu to determine if it is feasible to open a surf and shake shop all year-round in Oahu.

From the above images the key points in June and December weather are as follows-


- **The mean temperature for June is 75 degree F and for December is 71 degree F** 

- **The range in June temperature data is 21 degree F (max temp 85F, min temp 64 F)and the range in December temperature data is 27 degree F(max temp 83F, min temp 56F)** 

- **The standard deviation for June is 3.25 degree F and for December is 3.7 degree F** 


## Summary 
The mean temperature in June and December is in the comfortable range in Oahu. The spread of temperature is more in December so temperature can vary more in December. The interquartile range are almost the same for both June and December. 


### Additional queries-
Additional queries can be performed about precipitation from this weather data. It will be useful to find out how often and how much does it rain in Oahu.
